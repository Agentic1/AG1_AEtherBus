Cleanup/Robustification To-Do List for AG1_AetherBus Library Code ONLY:
Focus Files: envelope.py, keys.py, bus.py, rpc.py, bus_adapterV2.py
Overall Goals:
Ensure stability and reliability of core messaging.
Improve error handling and make it consistent.
Enhance logging for better debuggability.
Clarify and simplify interfaces where possible.
Detailed To-Do List:
envelope.py (Envelope Class):
Solidify Fields & Typing: Review all fields. Use Pydantic or Dataclasses with strict type hints if not already. Ensure all fields have sensible defaults where appropriate (e.g., meta defaults to {}, timestamp auto-generates).
Robust Serialization: Make to_dict() and from_dict() (or Pydantic equivalents) bulletproof. Test with missing optional fields, extra fields, and incorrect types in input for from_dict(). from_dict() should raise clear, specific errors or handle them gracefully.
__repr__ / __str__: Implement for concise and informative logging (e.g., showing envelope_id, role, agent_name, type, and keys in content rather than the full verbose content).
keys.py (StreamKeyBuilder Class):
Review Naming Conventions: Ensure all generated keys are consistent and avoid potential collisions.
Add Methods for All Key Types: If new key types have emerged (e.g., for the HTTP Gateway registration), add dedicated methods for them.
Documentation: Ensure each method clearly documents the key pattern it generates.
bus.py (Core Bus Operations):
build_redis_url():
Add clear logging of which environment variables are being used and the final URL (password masked).
Handle cases where essential env vars are missing by raising a ConfigurationError or logging a fatal error and exiting if the agent cannot run without it.
publish_envelope():
Input Validation: Add explicit check: if stream_name is None or empty string, log a CRITICAL error and return (or raise an exception). This addresses your [BUS][Publish] no stream issue directly.
Serialization Robustness: Wrap envelope.to_dict() and json.dumps() in try-except and log errors clearly if serialization fails.
XADD Error Handling: Catch specific Redis exceptions (e.g., redis.exceptions.ConnectionError, redis.exceptions.RedisError) around await redis.xadd(...) and log them with context (stream name, envelope ID).
subscribe_simple() (and subscribe() if it's the main workhorse):
Error Handling in Loop:
Inside the while True: loop, wrap the message processing block (from xreadgroup to callback invocation and xack) in a try...except Exception as e_msg_proc:.
If an error occurs processing a specific message (e.g., JSON decode error, Envelope.from_dict error, error within the agent's callback):
Log the error with traceback and the problematic message ID/data.
Crucially, XACK the problematic message so it's not re-delivered infinitely.
continue the loop to process the next message. A single bad message should not stop the entire subscription.
Deserialization Robustness: Before calling Envelope.from_dict(), check if the loaded JSON is actually a dictionary. Handle JSONDecodeError specifically.
Redis Connection Resilience: If xreadgroup raises a ConnectionError, the loop will likely break. The BusAdapterV2 or the main agent script should have a higher-level retry mechanism for re-establishing subscriptions if the Redis connection is temporarily lost. subscribe_simple itself could have a limited internal retry for xreadgroup connection issues.
Graceful Shutdown: Ensure asyncio.CancelledError is caught in the while True loop to allow the task to clean up and exit if adapter.stop() cancels it.
Logging: Add logs for group creation, consumer creation, messages received (ID only perhaps), messages ACKed.
rpc.py (bus_rpc_call, bus_rpc_envelope):
bus_rpc_call - THE BIG ONE:
reply_to Stream: It MUST use the request_env.reply_to (which bus_rpc_envelope ensures is set to a unique temporary stream) as the stream name for its redis.xread() call. The error XREAD on None or Invalid input of type: 'NoneType' means this was the primary bug.
Logging: Add detailed logs:
The target_stream and request_env.reply_to it's using.
Before publishing the request.
The exact stream name and last_id it's using for each XREAD attempt.
When XREAD returns data (even if empty) or times out for that specific block.
Timeout Logic: The while time.time() < deadline loop is okay, but ensure current_block_ms in redis.xread(..., block=current_block_ms) is calculated correctly and is always positive. redis-py's block is in milliseconds.
Response Extraction: Ensure fields.get(b"data") or fields.get("data") and the subsequent decode are robust. If 'data' is missing or not a string/bytes, it should return None or log an error rather than crashing.
bus_rpc_envelope:
The fallback logic for request_envelope.reply_to is good.
Its error handling for deserializing the response from bus_rpc_call looks reasonable. Ensure it clearly logs if bus_rpc_call returns None (timeout).
Temporary Stream Cleanup (for bus_rpc_envelope's fallback reply_to): If bus_rpc_envelope generates a fallback reply_to stream, it should ideally be responsible for trying to DELete that stream in a finally block after bus_rpc_call returns, regardless of success or failure. This prevents orphaned temporary streams.
bus_adapterV2.py (BusAdapterV2):
start(): Ensure it correctly awaits the startup of all its internal subscription tasks.
stop(): Ensure it correctly cancels and awaits all internal subscription tasks for a clean shutdown. Log this process.
Error Propagation: If a subscription task managed by the adapter dies permanently, how is this signaled or handled? Does the adapter try to restart it? (This might be advanced, but good to think about).
This list focuses purely on making the AetherBus library itself more robust, testable, and debuggable. Once these foundations are solid, building reliable agents on top becomes much easier. The rpc.py fixes are the most critical for your immediate "no response" issues with ASIOneClientAgent.
