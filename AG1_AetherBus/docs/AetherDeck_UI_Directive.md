Immediate Next Steps (The "Green Fields" Exploration)
Now that the core messaging pipeline is robust, we can focus on enriching the interaction.
Enable MuseAgent to Generate Rich UI Directives:
Goal: MuseAgent should be able to instruct AetherDeck to do more than just append text (e.g., create new windows, add buttons, input fields, images, charts).
How:
Prompt Engineering: Update MuseAgent's (especially Coordinator or Muse1) system prompt to teach it the AetherDeck UiDirective JSON schema (CREATE_WINDOW, ADD_COMPONENT_TO_WINDOW, SHOW_NOTIFICATION, etc.). Give it examples.
Tooling (Optional but Recommended): Consider creating a function_tool like send_ui_directive that takes arguments corresponding to directive_type and payload. This gives the LLM a structured way to output UI.
Relay's directive_envelope_handler: It's already set up to receive and directly send_json any content that has a "directive_type". So, the relay is ready for this.
Basic "Context-Aware" Window Management from MuseAgent:
Goal: MuseAgent should be able to (via LLM decision) open a new window for a specific task (e.g., "Here's your ETH balance in a dedicated window") without creating duplicates.
How:
System Prompt: Instruct the LLM on concepts like window_id (e.g., "Always use eth_balance_window for ETH balance displays. If it exists, update it; otherwise, create it.").
Internal State: MuseAgent might need a simple in-memory map of user_id -> active_window_ids to help the LLM (or a custom tool) decide whether to send CREATE_WINDOW or UPDATE_WINDOW_CONTENT.
Graceful Error Handling and User Feedback from Agents:
Goal: If a tool fails (e.g., invalid ETH address, MCP bridge error), the agent should format the error message as a user-friendly AetherDeck notification.
How:
System Prompt: Reinforce the LLM's role in conveying errors clearly to the user, perhaps using a SHOW_NOTIFICATION directive for critical issues or a structured text response.
Tool Wrappers: Modify tool execution wrappers (_dynamic_tool_execution_wrapper or consult_agent) to catch exceptions and produce structured error messages or UI directives for the LLM to include in its final response.
Integrate Other Agents/Services with AetherDeck UI:
Goal: Allow other agents (e.g., HeartBeat, a new Data Analyst agent) to directly send UI directives to AetherDeck (not just text).
How:
Standardized Envelope content: Ensure all agents know that Envelope.content can be a rich UI directive dict (containing "directive_type").
Reply-To Propagation: When agents receive an Envelope (e.g., for consultation), they must correctly propagate the reply_to and user_id to their own output Envelope if their response is meant for the original UI.
AetherDeck-Specific FunctionTool for MuseAgent:
Goal: Provide MuseAgent with dedicated tools to interact with AetherDeck's features programmatically.
How:
Create FunctionTools like create_aetherdeck_window(window_id, title, components, ...) or append_to_chat_log(message: str).
These tools would, in turn, construct the appropriate UiDirective dictionary and put it into an Envelope to publish on the reply_to stream (e.g., AG1:edge:aetherdeck:<user_id>:response). This allows the LLM to directly "call" UI actions.
Basic UI State Persistence (e.g., Chat History Reload):
Goal: When an AetherDeck client reconnects, the conversation history should ideally reappear in the main_chat_window.
How:
Agent Memory: MuseAgent could store conversation history in its memory (e.g., MemoryManager) indexed by user_id.
On Session Start/Reconnect: When handle_bus_envelope detects a new session for an existing user_id, it could retrieve past messages from memory.
Relay CREATE_WINDOW modification: The websocket_handler in relay_server.py could potentially query MuseAgent for past history via an RPC call before sending the initial CREATE_WINDOW, populating initial_components with the history. This is more advanced as it requires a synchronous call from the relay to the agent on connect.

This is an exciting roadmap, Dr. Livingstone! We've established the vital communication arteries; now we can start sending much richer information through them.
