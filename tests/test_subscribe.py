"""
test_subscribe.py

Purpose:
    Subscribes to an agent's inbox stream on the AG1 core bus and prints received Envelope messages.

Usage:
    $ python test_subscribe.py

Expected Output:
    - Prints subscription details and any Envelope received on the subscribed stream.
    - On success, output will show details of each Envelope as it arrives (role, content, session).

Verifying:
    Use another script (e.g., test_send.py) to publish a message to the stream and confirm it is received here.

Note:
    - Requires a running Redis instance and correct core bus configuration.
    - The script subscribes to agent_name='pa0'; edit as needed for other agents/streams.
